# Leavesly
In Bedrock Edition, there is an exclusive feature that turns some of the leaves white when it is snowing. Leavesly brings this feature to Java Edition with some enhancements, such as:
- Snow will affect all leaves.
- Vines are also affected by snow.
- There are different levels of coverage depending on the exposure of the leaves to the snow.
- Flowers and fruits from the leaves are not affected by the snow.
- Jungle leaves now have cocoa pods.
